# TTS_BY_RAG
Text to speech using RAG

ðŸ“˜ RAG-Based PDF Q&A System (Offline)

This project is a chatbot for your PDF files.
It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to read your documents, understand them, and answer your questions in its own words.

If you ask something outside the PDF, it will politely say:

> "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based only on the given context".


The app runs offline with a lightweight HuggingFace model and provides a simple Streamlit interface.



 Features

Chat with your PDF (ask natural questions)
 Generates answers in its own words (not just copy-paste)
 Rejects unrelated questions
 Speaks answers aloud using text-to-speech
 Offline model (no API key required)



 Tools Used

Python â€“ programming language

LangChain â€“ connects LLM with ChromaDB and retriever logic

HuggingFace Transformers â€“ loads the FLAN-T5 model

ChromaDB â€“ stores embeddings (vector database)

Streamlit â€“ builds the web interface

pyttsx3 â€“ converts text answers to speech

 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1 Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG_SYSTEM.git
cd RAG_SYSTEM

2 Create a virtual environment

python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

3 Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4 Place your PDF

Put your study notes or any PDF file into the mypdf/ folder.

5 Generate embeddings

This converts your PDF into vector embeddings for search.

python create_embeddings.py

6 Create ChromaDB

Builds and saves the vector database.

python create_chromadb.py

7 Run the app

streamlit run app.py

After this, youâ€™ll see a local link in your terminal.
Open it in your browser â†’ ask questions to your PDF!



 Example Usage

 Question (from PDF):

What are the main types of data in data science?

 Answer (generated):

Data can be structured or unstructured. It is also classified by how it is measured, such as numerical, categorical, or time-series data. These classifications help decide how analysis methods are applied.

 Question (not in PDF):

Who is BTS?

 Answer:

"You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based only on the given context".




 Future Improvements

Multiple PDF support

GPU acceleration

Smarter refusal for unrelated queries

Better summarization models
